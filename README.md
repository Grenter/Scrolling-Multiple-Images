# Scrolling-Multiple-Images
Simple Scrolling example using kirualex's SKScollingNode from https://github.com/kirualex/SprityBird to infinite scroll multiple images.

I was looking for an example where I can change the background image and keep an infinite scroll after trying loads of different ways I found kirualex's example, which was fantastic however it only took the one image so I re worked his example to handle multiple images.
